				Increased droughts and related water scarcity scenarios are expected to be one of the harmful effects of global warming
and, because of the local nature of these phenomena, some areas will be more prone to them than others. Understanding
and properly measuring the overall and sector-wide economic impact of those episodes at the geographically finest available
level is of crucial importance for the design of disaster risk management instruments and other policy-related issues. At the
same time, it becomes necessary to assess whether this response varies over time. In other words, we need to know
whether we adapt to climate change. Adaptation in the context of climate change is a concept that raises many questions:
empirical estimates are scarce and highly desired by scientists and institutions, like the IPCC; how this adaptation
mechanism can be embedded into economic models of climate change is also an unresolved issue. I will try to address both
in this project.</p>
                <p>The objective of my research is twofold: on the one hand, measuring the economic impacts of droughts and test for the
existence of adapting behaviour in the context of responses to droughts and, on the other hand, respond the demands of the
IPCC that urge for progress in the integration and modelling of adaptation into climate-economy models. To do so, in a first
stage I will apply econometric techniques envisaged by the new climate-economy literature to regionally detailed data to
obtain estimates of the economic impacts of droughts and adapting behaviour. Then, I will resort to sophisticated climateeconomy
models, like CGE and IAM models, to shed light into the modelling of adapting behaviour under potentially
stochastic scenarios.</p>
